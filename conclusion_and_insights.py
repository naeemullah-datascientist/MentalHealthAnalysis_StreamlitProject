    - **Encourage Open Conversations**: Foster a culture of openness around mental health in the workplace. This will reduce stigma, raise awareness, and help employees feel supported.

    - **Promote Work-Life Balance**: Initiatives to enhance work-life balance, including flexible working hours and remote work opportunities, can play a pivotal role in preventing burnout.

    - **Conduct Regular Check-ins**: Regular one-on-one check-ins can help identify early signs of mental health struggles, enabling companies to provide timely support.
